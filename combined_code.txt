# Chevron Corporation

Chevron Corporation, established in 1879 as the Pacific Coast Oil Company, is a leading American multinational energy corporation. Headquartered in San Ramon, California, Chevron operates in over 180 countries, engaging in various aspects of the oil, natural gas, and geothermal energy industries. ([chevron.com](https://www.chevron.com/who-we-are/history), [statista.com](https://www.statista.com/topics/5256/chevron/))

## Operations

Chevron's operations encompass the entire energy spectrum, including:

- **Exploration and Production**: Discovering and extracting crude oil and natural gas.
- **Refining and Marketing**: Processing crude oil into refined products and distributing them globally.
- **Chemicals Manufacturing**: Producing petrochemicals and additives.
- **Power Generation**: Engaging in geothermal energy production.

The company is committed to delivering affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy to meet the world's growing demands. ([chevron.com](https://www.chevron.com/what-we-do))

## Recent Developments

- **Financial Performance**: In the third quarter of 2024, Chevron reported a 21% decline in profits to $4.5 billion, attributed to falling oil prices and narrower fuel-making margins. Despite this, the company exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, partly due to a 7% increase in oil production to 3.36 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, largely from its U.S. shale operations. ([wsj.com](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/exxon-and-chevron-feel-brunt-of-cheaper-oil-7aa7461e?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

- **Strategic Moves**: Chevron announced plans to relocate its headquarters from California to Houston, Texas, citing the state's more favorable regulatory environment. This move is part of a broader trend of companies shifting operations to Texas. ([thetimes.co.uk](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chevron-becomes-the-latest-big-company-to-quit-california-pv8m50qwg?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

- **Asset Divestment**: The company plans to exit the UK North Sea oil and gas sector by selling its remaining assets, ending its 55-year presence in the region. This sale aligns with Chevron's efforts to finalize its $53 billion acquisition of Hess and involves divesting up to $20 billion in global assets. ([thetimes.co.uk](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chevron-to-sell-remaining-north-sea-oil-and-gas-assets-w999bmhlq?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Chevron is actively investing in technologies and projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainability. The company focuses on carbon capture and storage, renewable fuels, and other innovations to advance a lower-carbon future. ([chevron.com](https://www.chevron.com/what-we-do))
