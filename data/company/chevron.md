## Recent Developments

- **Financial Performance**: In the third quarter of 2024, Chevron reported a 21% decline in profits to $4.5 billion, attributed to falling oil prices and narrower fuel-making margins. Despite this, the company exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, partly due to a 7% increase in oil production to 3.36 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, largely from its U.S. shale operations.
